              <p>
                The platform includes the ability to receive email alerts when a
                new review has been submitted. As part of ongoing efforts to
                increase engagement, my team was tasked with implementing SMS
                alerts for new reviews.
              </p>
              <p>
                I updated the database to allow phone numbers to be saved at the
                user level and edited the logic around looking up alerts to
                accommodate the new alert type. Additionally, I added more
                safeguards around the backend to ensure alerts were not being
                duplicated, and that both email and SMS alerts could be sent out
                properly.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also implemented several front-end changes associated with SMS
                alerts, most notably the ability to input a phone number when
                creating or editing an SMS alert. I added a modal that
                double-checks that users really mean to update an existing phone
                number, and ensures alerts cannot be created if there is no
                phone number associated with the user.
              </p>

                  SMS alerts are labeled in the alerts table. Clicking on an
                  alert allows you to edit alert information, including the
                  phone number. When a phone number is updated, the user is
                  warned that this will update all SMS alerts for this user.

            <div class="portfolio-row-job-specific">
              <p>
                Prior to this project, Customer Support created QBR decks for
                customers by hand by doing a lot of manual copying and pasting.
                In order to make their lives easier, we developed automated QBRs
                using Google Slides and implemented a user interface accessible
                through an internal app.
              </p>
              <p>
                The reports themselves pull data from the database, then update
                placeholders in a slide deck. The front end includes
                functionality to quickly download and prepare an email with
                user-entered text.
              </p>
              <p>
                I implemented key features in the slides themselves, including
                the logic around color bars and trend arrows showing some
                at-a-glance metrics and API calls to update that data in the
                slide deck, the ability to delete slide decks, and parts of the
                logic around saving files. Additionally, I also built out the
                majority of the front-end component.

              <p>
                We created an autogenerated response feature for users who may
                not be sure how to begin responding to reviews. Clicking the
                ghostwriter button provides a suggested response, designed to
                match the review sentiment.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was tasked with some of the front end work, as well as
                incorporating autogenerated reviews into immediate alert emails,
                including edits to the API in order to only provide responses
                appropriate for emails.
