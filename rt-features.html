              <h3>SMS Alerts</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="portfolio-row-job-specific">
              <p>
                The platform includes the ability to receive email alerts when a new review has been submitted.
                As part of ongoing efforts to improve alerts, my team was tasked with implementing SMS alerts.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of my tasks was implementing phone numbers associated with specific users, which required making updates to our database and the logic around looking up and sending alerts. Additionally, I needed to add more backend data checks to ensure alerts were not being duplicated, and changes to ensure both SMS and email alerts could be triggered for an individual person.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, I implemented front-end changes associated with SMS alerts. Users can input a phone number when creating or editing an SMS alert, users are warned that updating a phone number will change the number for all alerts, and alerts cannot be saved if there is no phone number associated with the user.
              </p>
            </div>

                  SMS alerts are labeled as such in the alerts table. Clicking on an alert allows you to edit alert information,
                  including the phone number. When a phone number is updated, the user is warned that this will update all
                  SMS alerts for this user.

              <h3>Automated QBR Decks</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="portfolio-row-job-specific">
              <p>
                Customer Support created QBR decks for customers by hand, which required a lot of manual copying and pasting. In order to make their lives easier, we developed automated QBRs using Google Sheets, and implemented a front end accessible through an internal app.
              </p>
              <p>
                The reports themselves pull data from the database, then update placeholders in a slide deck. The front end includes functionality to quickly download and prepare an email with user-entered text.
              </p>
              <p>
                I implemented key features in the slides themselves, including color bars and trend arrows showing some at-a-glance metrics, the ability to delete slide decks, and parts of the file saving logic. Additionally, I also built out the majority of the front-end component.
              </p>

              <p>
                We created an autogenerated response feature for users who may not be sure how to begin responding to reviews. On the page showing review details, we added a button that provides a suggested response, designed to match the review sentiment.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was tasked with some of the front end work, as well as incorporating autogenerated reviews into immediate alert emails. This required some edits to the API in order to only provide responses appropriate for emails.
