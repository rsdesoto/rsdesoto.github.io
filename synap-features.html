                Clients requested the ability to filter our search page to specific types of
                information or information with specific user-entered tags. I was tasked with creating the user interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                The biggest challenge was creating an intuitive design -- I found some of the initial designs confusing once I started implementing them, so I worked with our product design team to iron out some of the wrinkles.
                After some back and forth on how best to display the types of results that could be displayed and how to present potentially dozens of available tags to the user,
                we settled on the final design -- types of results (e.g., emails, notes, organizations) available as filter options are
                presented in a single section, and a separate modal displays all user-entered tags. Tags that are selected are displayed on the main search page so users can easily see what filters are applied.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of this project, I created nicely styled checkboxes and 3-state checkboxes
                for checking/unchecking an entire group of checkboxes.

              <h3>Entity Mapping Modal - Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, React</h3>

            <div class="portfolio-row-job-specific">
              <p>
                The application features integrations with 3rd party data. Prior to this project,
                mapping entities in the application to entities in Solovis, an instutional investment
                management program, had to be done by a member of the team. These mappings could not
                be set up by users of the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                A teammate and I worked together to create the necessary internal API endpoints,
                update an API client used to communicate with the Solovis API, and implement a
                mapping modal on the front end. Major challenges included figuring out what information was and was not available in the Solovis API, working out some implementation details around editing and deleting existing mappings, and handling hand-offs of the project between two different people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, some of the components of the front-end were fairly complicated --
                in particular, I created a text field that filtered a dropdown list of existing
                entities in Solovis that were available to be mapped to. I had to get clever
                with using tabindex along with mouse down events to group the dropdown with
                the text box, allowing them to be treated as a single distinct component with
                unified behavior instead of two completely separate elements.
              </p>

                Clients requested a print-specific view of notes. Prior to this feature,
                users would need to either screencap notes in the application, which would be inconvenient
                for longer notes and could include design elements that would be visually distracting in a
                print-out, or copy and paste information from the application to a printable
                document, which could introduce bad formatting and potentially lose information.
              </p>
              <p>
                I created a separate section of the application solely for print views, removing
                unnecessary features of the main app and implementing only the design elements and information
                necessary for displaying the note.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also created functionality to hide the comments associated with a note as needed.

              <p>
                Before I started on the project, modal implementation was somewhat scattershot -- some modals had headers and some didn't, some modals had buttons at the top and some had buttons at the bottom, and so on. After I implemented the new tag modal design, I went through the app to switch all modals to a single unified style.
              </p>
              <p>
                The biggest challenge here was actually around pulling out existing styles -- our modal had originally been a <a href="https://react.foundation/">Foundation</a> modal with built-in padding. Several of the modals in the app had a lot of brittle styling around overriding the existing modal styles.
              </p>
              <p>
                I pulled out unnecessary CSS styling I also created a new ModalHeader component, which gave us a consistent style and functionality for all our modals, allowing easier maintenance and unified user experience.
