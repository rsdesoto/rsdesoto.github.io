            <div class="portfolio-row-job-specific">
              <p>
                Clients requested the ability to filter our search page to specific types of
                information or information with specific user-entered tags.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was tasked with creating the user interface. I worked with our product
                design team to iron out the implementation. After some back and forth around
                the organization of each section and how to present potentially dozens of available tags to the user,
                we settled on the final design -- types of results (e.g., emails, notes, organizations) availble as filter options were
                presented as a single section, and a separate modal was created for user-entered tags. Tags that are selected are displayed on the main search page.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of this project, I created nicely styled checkboxes and 3-state checkboxes
                for checking/unchecking an entire group of checkboxes.
              </p>

                  Results can be filtered by type or by tag. Generally, clients only had between 5-15 available types; some clients had more than a hundred tags. In order to keep the tag section from overwhelming the screen, only tags being used to filter results were shown.

                  Clients requested a print-specific view of notes. Prior to this feature, there was no good way to print a note -- clients would either have to screencap their screens, or copy and paste information from the application to a printable document.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I created a separate section of the application, removing the majority of unneeded features and implementing only the information needed to show the note.
