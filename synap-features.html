              <h3>Global Search Filtering - HTML, CSS, React</h3>

              <p>
                Clients requested the ability to filter our search page to specific types of
                information or information with specific user-entered tags. I was tasked with creating the user interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                The biggest challenge was creating an intuitive design -- I found some of the initial designs confusing once I started implementing them, so I worked with our product design team to iron out some of the wrinkles.
                After some back and forth on how best to display the types of results that could be displayed and how to present potentially dozens of available tags to the user,
                we settled on the final design -- types of results (e.g., emails, notes, organizations) availble as filter options are
                presented in a single section, and a separate modal displays all user-entered tags. Tags that are selected are displayed on the main search page so users can easily see what filters are applied.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of this project, I created nicely styled checkboxes and 3-state checkboxes
                for checking/unchecking an entire group of checkboxes.

                  Results can be filtered by type or by tag. Generally, clients only had between 5-15 available types; some clients had more than a hundred tags. In order to keep the tag section from overwhelming the screen, only tags being used to filter results were shown.

              <p>
                The application features integrations with 3rd party data. Prior to this project,
                mapping entities in the application to entities in Solovis, an instutional investment
                management program, had to be done by a member of the team. These mappings could not
                be set up by users of the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                A teammate and I worked together to create the necessary internal API endpoints,
                update an API client used to communicate with the Solovis API, and implement a
                mapping modal on the front end. Major challenges included figuring out what information was and was not available in the Solovis API, working out some implementation details around editing and deleting existing mappings, and handling hand-offs of the project between two different people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, some of the components of the front-end were fairly complicated --
                in particular, I created a text field that filtered a dropdown list of existing
                entities in Solovis that were available to be mapped to. I had to get clever
                with using tabindex along with mouse down events to group the dropdown with
                the text box, allowing them to be treated as a single distinct component with
                unified behavior instead of two completely separate elements.
              </p>
