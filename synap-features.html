                Clients requested the ability to filter our search page to only
                return specific types of results, or results with user-entered
                tags. I was responsible for implementing the entire user
                interface for this feature.
              </p>
              <p>
                The biggest challenge was creating an intuitive design -- I
                found some of the expected behavior of the initial designs
                confusing once I started implementing them, so I worked with our
                product design team to iron out some of the wrinkles. After some
                back and forth on how best to display the types of results that
                could be displayed and how to present potentially dozens of
                available tags to the user, we settled on the final design
                collaboratively.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also found the technical challenge of presenting tags
                interesting. In order to avoid overwhelming the user, we created
                a separate modal with all tags available to filter on; once some
                tags have been selected, they appear on the main search page.
                Moving data from component to component was a fun challenge.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of this project, I created nicely styled checkboxes and
                3-state checkboxes for checking/unchecking an entire group of
                checkboxes.

                  Results can be filtered by type or by tag. Generally, clients
                  only had between 5-15 available types; some clients had more
                  than a hundred tags. In order to keep the tag section from
                  overwhelming the screen, only tags being used to filter
                  results were shown.

                In addition to filtering on desktop, we implemented

              <p>
                Instead of a sidebar with filtering options, I implemented an
                action sheet. This element and the button controlling it are
                both hidden in desktop view, and only displayed on small screen
                sizes. I worked with design on how to display tags without
                needing a modal.

                One of the biggest challenges was adjusting the the layout of
                search results. A teammate and I used CSS Grid to lay out
                elements of each result, which let us easily adjust how
                information is displayed in desktop versus mobile views.

              <p>
                Before I started on this project, modal implementation was
                somewhat scattershot -- some modals had headers and some didn't,
                some modals had buttons at the top and some had buttons at the
                bottom, and so on. After I implemented the new tag modal design,
                I went through the app to update all modals to a single unified
                style.
              </p>
              <p>
                The biggest challenge here was actually around pulling out
                existing styles -- our modal had originally been a
                <a href="https://react.foundation/">Foundation</a> modal with
                some built-in styling. Several of the modals in the app had a
                lot of brittle styling designed to override the existing modal
                styles. I removed as much styling as I could from the base
                modal, adding component-specific CSS as needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also created a new ModalHeader component that put buttons and
                other functionality into the modal header. This gave us a
                consistent style and functionality for all our modals, allowing
                easier maintenance and unified user experience.

                The application features integrations with 3rd party data; one
                of the main integrations is with Solovis, an institutional
                investment management program. Prior to the addition of this
                feature, mapping entities to Solovis had to be done by a member
                of the team and could not be done independently by users of the
                app.
              </p>
              <p>
                A teammate and I worked together to create the necessary
                internal API endpoints, update an API client used to communicate
                with the Solovis API, and implement a mapping modal on the front
                end. Major challenges included figuring out what information was
                and was not available in the Solovis API, working out some
                implementation details around around the user interface, and
                handling hand-offs of the project between two different people.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the meatier technical challenges was around creating a
                text input that filtered a dropdown list of existing entities in
                Solovis that were available for mapping. I had to get clever
                with using tabindex along with mouse down events to group the
                dropdown with the text box, allowing them to be treated as a
                single distinct component with unified focus and blur behavior
                instead of two completely separate elements.

                Clients requested a print-specific view of notes. Prior to this
                feature, users needed to either screencap notes in the
                application, which would be inconvenient for longer notes and
                would include visually distracting design elements; or copy and
                paste information from the application to a printable document,
                which would not be formatted correctly and could potentially not
                have all the information the user needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                I created a separate section of the application solely for print
                views, removing unnecessary features of the main app. I only
                implemented design elements and information necessary to display
                the note, while also still including useful features, like the
                ability to follow links to other parts of the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also added functionality to hide the comments associated with
                a note as needed.
