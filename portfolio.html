                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Built key sections of a new Claims app allowing customers
                    and internal claims agents to create electronic first
                    notices of loss. This allowed customers to submit
                    information to open a claim themselves without needing to
                    call in, and also allowed Kin to integrate with third party
                    vendors to handle after hours and overflow data collection.
                    To date, about 13,000 claims have been collected via the
                    Claims app.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Planned and led a major restructuring of Claims data,
                    consolidating three processes' worth of data and simplifying
                    team workflows accurately and without downtime, allowing for
                    more complicated projects that pull in data across multiple
                    parts of the Claims app.
                  </li>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Architected and led major updates to the first notice of
                    loss API, which included complete rewrites of several of the
                    endpoints and major changes to the underlying data models,
                    allowing the Claims app to handle several new categories of
                    claims and setting the foundations for offering additional
                    types of coverage in the future.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Wrote and presented architecture briefs to engineering
                    leadership and coordinated with other teams throughout the
                    company to ensure changes to the architecture would not
                    interrupt BI tools or data monitoring.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Led an ongoing effort to identify and triage tech debt
                    across all Claims teams.

                    Created a process that enabled Kin to collect low-intent
                    leads for the first time, including researching a third
                    party app to use, setting up API endpoints, syncing data in
                    our customer database, and setting up a dashboard so the
                    marketing team has access to tracking and metrics. To date,
                    about 17,000 leads have been collected. The process is also
                    generalized enough to be used in several other marketing
                    campaigns.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                  <li>
                    Ran weekly Claims meetings for devs and QE to collaborate on

                    on proposed changes to the Claims app.

              I built these during bootcamp - they're pretty old and not that
              representative of my current work (for one thing, I'm now pretty
              firmly a backend dev), but I still think a couple of them are
              pretty cute.
