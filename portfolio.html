                  I was part of the original team that designed and built the
                  Claims app from the ground up in 2022, and continue to work on
                  it today. As a senior engineer I’ve touched a lot of code,
                  including architecting and leading several projects.

                <p>
                  A couple of the things I’ve worked on over the last few years

                  <li class="portfolio-li">
                    I architected and led an integration with a 3rd party
                    vendor, allowing us to intake claims via SMS and phone. In
                    addition to the actual software that I wrote, I also handled
                    a lot of the coordination between Kin engineering, Kin
                    operations, and the vendor, ensuring we delivered the
                    product on time.

                  <li class="portfolio-li">
                    I architected and led a major restructuring of Claims data.
                    Due to several teams working on a very short deadline, we
                    had data being saved in several different places. I led the
                    effort to consolidate three processes’ worth of data
                    accurately and without downtime.

                  <li class="portfolio-li">
                    I architected and led major updates to the claim intake
                    process to allow us to process additional categories of
                    claims. This also shored up some vulnerabilities in our
                    endpoints, making the app more secure.

                  <li class="portfolio-li">
                    I established and built out patterns for looking up
                    role-based permissions as part of a larger initiative to
                    give Kin employees access to resources based on user roles.

                  <li class="portfolio-li">
                    I created a process that enabled Kin to collect low-intent
                    leads for the first time. In addition to setting up the
                    relevant API endpoints, I also needed to research which
                    third-party communication app to use, synced data between a
                    third party vendor and our customer database, and set up a
                    dashboard for the marketing team’s use.
